# Parameter Definitions {.new-page}

The normative definition of the Device:2 data model is provided in XML DM Instance documents, as defined by TR-106 [@TR-106] Annex A.

For a given revision of the data model, the corresponding TR-181 Issue 2 XML document defines the Device:2 model itself and imports additional components from the other XML documents listed.

Each TR-181 Issue 2 HTML document is a report generated from the XML files, and lists a consolidated view of the Device:2 data model in human-readable form.

For use with CWMP the corresponding Device:2 data model is published at [https://cwmp-data-models.broadband-forum.org](https://cwmp-data-models.broadband-forum.org/), and for use with USP the data model is published at [https://usp-data-models.broadband-forum.org](https://usp-data-models.broadband-forum.org/).
